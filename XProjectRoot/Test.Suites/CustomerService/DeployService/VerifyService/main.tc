# You are also able to do more complex testing. 
# Since i dont have any public test environmetn here is sample script for such action
# Scenario 1
# 1) Deploy Service to your linux box
# 2) Send httprequest to enter new customer (this will also verify if the service is working)
# 3) verify webservice has added new customer to the sql database (supported dbs: mysql,sql server)



# Deploy Service to your Linux box
$host = {your linux host machine/vm}
$user = {your username for the vm}
$pass = {your password for the vm}
$timeout = {60000} #timeout after 1 min. Set it higher if your dep takes longer

$cmd1 = {sudo apt-get install python-webpy;/tmp/deployrunservice.sh}

!ssh{$host,$user,$pass,$cmd,$timeout} # ssh into the box and deploy your service


# Send httprequest to enter new customer (this will also verify if the service is working)

$endpoint = {your servioce endpoint}
$requestbody = {your soap/rest message body}
$headers = {header:value;header2:value;etc...}

httprequest{post,$endpoint,$requestbody,$headers} # Add new customer
verify{value,StatusCode,200} # Verify success


# Go into SQl server to verify your new customer has been added

$server = {your sql server host}
$dbname = {your dbname}

$query = {select top 10 * Customers from Database where CustomerName="Your Name"}

sqlexecute{$server,$dbname,$query} # Send query to DB
verify{value,CustomerName,"Your Name"} # Verify customer has been found and its the correct name
